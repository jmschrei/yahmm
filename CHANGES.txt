v0.1.0, 4/28/2014 -- Initial commit

v0.1.1, 4/28/2014 -- Documentation and examples provided

v0.1.2, 5/5/2014 -- Changed instances of dtype=numpy.int to 
	dtype=numpy.int32, as other int types are not properly 
	recognized as integers on Unix machines, but as shorts or longs.

v0.1.3, 5/8/2014 -- Added optional removal of orphan states and chains
	in the bake method. Added two underflow protections: row
	normalization in the forward/backward algorithms, and a better
	logsumexp function. Fixed writing and reading so that the
	original distributions work. Still need to fix the functions
	under InverseGamma. Added more documentation.

v0.1.4, 5/11/2014 -- Infinite models are now possible, by simply not adding a transition to the end state. All algorithms accept this. You can make sure your model is an infinite model by calling "Model.is_infinite()". 

Added maximum a posteriori decoding, via "Model.maximum_a_posteriori( sequence )". This returns the mode of the posterior distribution of the states. This sequence may not necessarily be a valid sequence.

Added sampling from infinite models. If your model is infinite, you can pass in length to sample to get a sample of a certain length. You can also pass "path=True" to get the path of hidden states that generated that sample.

v0.1.5 5/18/2014 -- Fixed a bug with training that was introduced in v0.1.4. Because self.f and self.b were cast as double [:,:], they allowed for quick access. They were changed to f, and b, forgetting to cast them, making access extremely slow. This was fixed by casting f and b as double [:,:].

Fixed writing and reading. Previously, reading and writing only worked on Normal, Exponential, Gamma, InverseGamma distributions. Now works on all distributions, including mixtures of arbitrary distributions.

Sped up exponential and gamma distributions a tiny bit by changing the log function to the C log function.

v1.0.0 6/26/2014 -- Significant changes have been made, which make some functions no longer back compatible. 

(1) Read and write are no longer back compatible in order to have a more fully featured method pair. THESE FUNCTIONS DO NOT HANDLE TIED STATES YET. IF YOU WRITE A MODEL AND READ IT BACK IN, YOU WILL LOSE TIED STATE INFORMATION. This will be fixed shortly, but is currently not possible.

(2) Model.train now takes "labelled" as an algorithm type, and lets you pass in ( sequence, label ) tuples, where the label is state object that should have represented this. This is useful for hand notated data. Model._train_viterbi has been updated to simply be a wrapper for this function, where it calculates the viterbi path of an unlabelled sequence before passing it into Model._train_labelled.

(3) Edge intertia now added, meaning that in the training algorithms, the new training edge will be x*(1-p) + y*(p) where p is the edge inertia, x is the new value estimated, and y was the previous value. Each iteration of Baum-Welch will use y as the value calculated in the previous iteration, meaning it can change more than the amount specified over the total number of iterations.

(4) Transition pseudocounts are now added for training in two manners. The first is that in Model.train, you can pass in transition_pseudocount=x, where x is some float. The pseudocount is just a count applied to each edge which already exists when summing the number of times an edge is crossed. The second is to specify a pseudocount for a specific edge, using Model.add_transition( x, y, probability=z, pseudocount=p ). When training, you must toggle use_pseudocount=True in order to use. An example would be model.train( [sequences], algorithm='baum-welch', use_pseudocount=True ), or model.train( [sequences], algorithm='baum-welch', transition_pseudocount=1.5 ), or even model.train( [sequences], algorithm='baum_welch', use_pseudocount=True, transition_pseudocount=1.3 ). Pseudocounts apply to all training algorithms, not just Baum-Welch.

(5) Model.log_probability( sequence ) has been added as a method to calculate the log probability score of a sequence. On finite models, this is just a wrapper for model.forward( sequence )[ len(sequence), model.end_index ]. On infinite models, it will sum the last row of the forward matrix for symbol-emitting states, as there is no specific end state.

(6) State Weights have been added, and can be specified by indicating State( distribution, name, weight=x ), where X is the weight. By default this is 1. This is a bonus (or penalty) to add to the aligning of any sequence item to this state, and effects all algorithms allowing for weighted algorithms.

(7) MultivariateDistribution is a new distribution type which allows you to specify distributions over an arbitrary number of independent distributions of any type. You specify it by passing in a list of distributions like the following: MultivariateDistribution( [ NormalDistribution( 5, 2 ), ExponentialDistribution( 10 ) ] ). All current methods work with it, but now all sequence items must be tuples of length equal to the number of distributions.

(8) Previously, rows were normalized during the forward and backward algorithm. This caused huge slow downs for no gain, as the logsumexp function handled underflow. These have been removed. 

v1.0.1a, 8/26/2014 --
(1) Distribution inertia added for all distributions. This means that parameters for the distributions are updated to be inertia*prior_parameters + (1-inertia)*new_parameters. This can be triggered using `distribution_inertia` in the `Model.train` method.

(2) Summary statistics implemented for Baum-Welch training. This involves summarizing one sequence at a time and storing the appropriate summary statistics to the distribution object using `Distribution.summarize( items, weights )`, and then updating the parameters using these summary statistics and an appropriate inertia with `Distribution.from_summarize( inertia=0.0 )`. This makes training on large numbers of sequences always faster, but training on small numbers of long sequences take slightly longer. 

(3) Nosetests significantly expanded to include more tests. This includes a new file `test_training.py`, which has a large number of tests on the Viterbi and Baum-Welch training algorithms, with different parameters. This also includes expanded testing of each distribution, and each of the training functions for that sample.

v1.1.0, 9.12/2014 --
(1) Distribution freezing and thawing added. If a distribution is frozen, it will not change after training. This is useful if you know that some parameterization of the distribution is correct. This can be done on a distribution level, or on the entire model. Thawing a frozen state returns it to normal.

(2) Now Python3 compatible.

(3) Tied edges now added. When training, a transition over an edge now counts as a transition across any edge it is tied to. This can be done easily using the `group` keyword in the `add_transition` function.

(4) `add_transitions` added to the Model class, as a way to add many transitions as a batch.

v1.1.1 12/9/2014
(1) log_probability( model, samples ) function added, which calculates the log probability of a group of samples given a model. This can be either a distribution or a HMM.

(2) MixtureDistribution bug fixed in which it would only look at the first two distributions when calculating log probability

(3) EM algorithm added to train MixtureDistributions. Both emission and weight updates added.

(4) Error in NormalDistribution.from_summaries in which it did not respect min_std. This worked for from_sample but not from_summaries.

v1.1.3 1/18/2015 - Fixed error in backward algorithm on infinite models. Initialization should have been 0's.
